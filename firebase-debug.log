Module not found: Can't resolve 'nodemailer'
Did you mean './nodemailer'?
Requests that should resolve in the current directory need to start with './'.
Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (node_modules, D:\Development\2025\Pillgrim\pilgrimdian).
If changing the source code is not an option there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative' which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.
